# Rock or Mine Sonar 

This project focuses on detecting mines or rocks using sonar data through machine learning techniques. By analyzing sonar signals, the model aims to classify objects as either mines or rocks, enhancing safety and efficiency in various applications such as military and geological surveys.

# Project Overview
The project is organized to include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. The final model can be used for identifying the presence of mines or rocks based on sonar data.

# File Structure
[Detecting-Mine-or-Rock-Sonar-K-Nearest-Neighbors.ipynb](https://github.com/shrek-28/rock-or-mine-sonar/blob/main/Detecting%20Mine%20or%20Rock%20Sonar%20-%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb): The main Jupyter Notebook that contains all steps of the project, including data cleaning, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
Install the required libraries using the following command:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

# Getting Started
* Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mine-rock-sonar-detection.git
cd mine-rock-sonar-detection
```
* Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the [Detecting-Mine-or-Rock-Sonar-K-Nearest-Neighbors.ipynb](https://github.com/shrek-28/rock-or-mine-sonar/blob/main/Detecting%20Mine%20or%20Rock%20Sonar%20-%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb) notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to execute the full workflow.

# Project Workflow
* Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Normalize and scale the sonar data for model compatibility.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of sonar signals.
- Analyze the relationships between features and the target variable (mine or rock).
* Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features for modeling.
* Modeling:
- Implement various classification models, with a focus on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Train models on the processed sonar dataset.
* Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Compare different models and select the best-performing one.

# Results
The final model provides accurate predictions for detecting mines or rocks from sonar data, which can be beneficial for safety in military operations and geological assessments.

# Future Improvements
* Incorporating additional sonar features or data for improved detection accuracy.
* Implementing more advanced models like Support Vector Machines or Neural Networks.
* Deploying the model for real-time detection applications.
